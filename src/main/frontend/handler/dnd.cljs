  "There can be at least 3 possible situations:
  1. Move a block in the same file (either top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top).
  2. Move a block between two different files.
  3. Move a block between two files in different repos.

  Notes:
  1. Those two blocks might have different formats, e.g. one is `org` and another is `markdown`,
     we don't handle this now. TODO: transform between different formats in mldoc.
  2. Sometimes we might need to move a parent block to it's own child.
